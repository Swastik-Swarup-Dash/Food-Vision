A Deep Leaning project using Computer Vision and Transfer-Leaning
 * Downloading and preparing 10% of the Food101 data (10% of training data)
 * Training a feature extraction transfer learning model on 10% of the Food101 training data
 * Fine-tuning our feature extraction model
 * Saving and loaded our trained model
 * Evaluating the performance of our Food Vision model trained on 10% of the training data
 * Finding our model's most wrong predictions
 * Making predictions with our Food Vision model on custom images of food
